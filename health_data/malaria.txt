Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable.

The initial symptoms of malaria are fever, headache, and chills. These may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, often leading to death. Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria.

Vector control is the main way to prevent and reduce malaria transmission. Two recommended methods are using insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying. Antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent malaria.
