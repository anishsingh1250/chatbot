Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting people against harmful diseases, before they come into contact with them. It uses your bodyâ€™s natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger.

The National Immunisation Schedule in India recommends several key vaccines for infants. At birth, BCG, Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV 0), and Hepatitis B (Birth dose) are given. At 6 weeks, OPV 1, Rotavirus 1, and Pentavalent 1 are administered. At 10 weeks, the second doses are given, and at 14 weeks, the third doses.

The Measles-Rubella (MR) 1st dose is given between 9 to 12 months. It is crucial for parents to follow this schedule to protect their children from preventable diseases. All these vaccines are available for free at government health facilities.
